# Shinydashboard templates

This repo includes two templates for building Shiny apps using the `shinydashboard` package.

There are two templates to choose from:

1. [**shinydashboard**](shinydashboard) - for smaller apps this template is a bit less work to set up, and doesn't require an understanding of Shiny modules
1. [**shinydashboard_modular**](shinydashboard_modular) - for larger apps where you need to break up your code or work with multiple authors.

If you're just getting started with Shiny and want to use these templates, you probably want to read some or all of these first:

* [**Introductions and Tutorials**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)
* [**App formats and launching apps**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/app-formats.html)
* [**Shiny Reactivity**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/reactivity-overview.html)
* [**Understanding Reactivity**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/understanding-reactivity.html)
* [**Execution Scheduling**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/execution-scheduling.html)
* [**Getting started with shinydashboard**](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html)
* [**Shinydashboard structure**](http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html)
* [**Grid Layouts in Depth**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html#grid-layouts-in-depth) (helpful to understand how the bootstrap layout system works)

Keep in mind that **shinydashboard** is an extension to the **Shiny** framework, so a lot of the tutorials will use "base" Shiny to demonstrate things like reactivity, app structure, etc. Don't worry that the app looks different (ugly), it's the concepts that matter.
